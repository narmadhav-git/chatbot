# chatbot
Built a PDF-based chatbot using Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, and NVIDIA LLaMA (Nemotron-70B). The system extracts PDF text, embeds it with SentenceTransformers, and retrieves relevant context to answer user queries in natural language, maintaining conversation history for context-aware responses.
